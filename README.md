# little-space-x

## Project Description
-The user will have to choose letters to fill in the blanks of a phrase or word.
-Each letter they get right will fill into the phrase or word and help our space traveler fix his ship to make it home.
-Each time the user gets a letter wrong, a meter with the amount of fuel the ship has to make it home will go sown one step.
-if the user can figure out the phrase before the fuel runs out, the user will have won and successfully helped the space traveler make it home.
-if the user does not figure out the phrase before the fuel runs out the user will be prompted that he /she / they have lave lost, and our friend the space traveler will not have enough fuel to make it home. and give them the option to try again.
